# Pokedex (Mobile)
![React Native](https://img.shields.io/badge/react_native-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB)

This is a mobile application built on React Native.  
Initially, I started this to try out some animations üòÇ but it ended up teaching me lots about React (file organizations, alias path, etc.)  

**Note:** Data is imported from JSON file locally (Merged [Biuni](https://github.com/Biuni/PokemonGO-Pokedex/blob/master/pokedex.json
)'s and [Fanzeyi](https://github.com/fanzeyi/pokemon.json)'s JSON files using [JSON Merger VSCode extension](https://github.com/A-amon/json-merger)) 

## How it works

**Note:**  
```
The *Moves* screen is empty  
  
There were initially two issues encountered in this project (due to re-rendering after new data are added):
- Styling messed up
- List re-starts from top (not continuing from last seen item/index)  

Solution:  
'initialScrollIndex' prop (BUT, effect will be voided (re-start at top again) once started scrolling a little üòÇ) and  
messy styling issue fixed  

Also tried scrollToOffset but couldn't make it work (possibly due to this issue: https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated/issues/587)
```
