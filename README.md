> Incomplete/ For learning  

This is a mobile application built on React Native.  
Initially, I started this to try out some animations ðŸ˜‚ but it ended up teaching me lots about React (file organizations, alias path, etc.)  

**Note:** Data is imported from JSON file locally (Merged [Biuni](https://github.com/Biuni/PokemonGO-Pokedex/blob/master/pokedex.json
)'s and [Fanzeyi](https://github.com/fanzeyi/pokemon.json)'s JSON files) using [JSON Merger VSCode extension](https://github.com/A-amon/json-merger)
